### Statement

> You are given an array `prices where prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the `maximum profit` you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### You can try it at

- https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

```

### Approach

- simply we traverse the prices and at `ith` iteration we assume `prices[i] as the end point`
- ans simultaneously we track the minimum price
- so `minimum price` will act as the start point
- hence on each iteration we compare the `prices[i]-minimum_price` with `max_profit`

### Code

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```js
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        // approach is simply we need to track the the min element from left to right
        int mini = prices[0];
        for(int price: prices){
            // we assume current price at price[i] to be the end point 
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit,price-mini);
            // track the minimum which will be our start point
            mini = Math.min(mini,price);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
