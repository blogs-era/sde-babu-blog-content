# Segment Trees

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

### Definition

> Segment Tree is a data structure that stores the information about the range of an array.so this data structure can help us to answer the range related questions in efficient manner.

### Use case

> let suppose we have `arr[]` -> `0,1,8,2,1,5` and `query` as Q = `[[1,4],[2,4],[0,2]]`, now we need to return sum of elements in the range for each `query`.where `query` represents `[start,end]`

- for query: [1,4] -> `1 + 8 + 2 + 1`
- for query: [2,4] -> `8 + 2 + 1`
- for query: [0,2] -> `0 + 1 + 8`

> now what will the time complexity for `brute force` method ?

>> so it will be `O(N*Q)` becuase for `Q` query we have to calculate the sum of the elements in the range.

### Conclusion 

#### hence for reducing the time complexity we use Segment Trees

### How Segment Trees can help ?

#### 1. first we need to know how to build the Segment tree for given array for `range sum query`

### Code for building Segment Tree

```js
    /**
    * SegmentTree
    */
    public class SegmentTree {
        int[] arr;
        int[] segment_tree;

        // constructor
        SegmentTree(int n){
            arr = new int[n];
            // we take size of segment tree as 4 times of n (upperlimit) 
            segment_tree = new int[4*n];
        }
        // build the segment tree
        void build(int low,int high,int index){
            // base case if low is equals to high then only one element is there 
            if(low==high){
                segment_tree[index] = arr[low];
                return;
            }
            int mid = (low+high)/2;
            build(low, mid, 2*index+1);
            build(mid+1, high, 2*index+2);

            // fill this index after returning from recursion
            segment_tree[index] = segment_tree[2*index+1] + segment_tree[2*index+2];
        }
    }

#### 2. after building the segment tree we have to write a `query` function to calculate the sum for the given range

- first take the complete array as our range then reduce the range of our search 
- so we have to consider three cases for reducing the complete range 
- `first` is `no-overlap` it happens when `[l h] q[0] q[1]` or `q[0] q[1] [l h]` means the query range and our search range does'nt overlap then there is no contribution in `sum` so return `0`.
- `second` is `complete overlap` means `q[0] l h q[1]` so take `segment_tree[index]`.
- `third` is `partial overlap` then we have to recurse the same process for sub-section from `l - m` and `m+1 - h`  

#### Lets understand with an example

### Next Topic is Point Updates

> what is point updates ?

> let suppose there is one more type of query in which we have to update the element at index `i` with value `val`.

> let suppose we have `arr[]` -> `0,1,8,2,1,5` and `query` as Q = `[[1,4,1],[2,4,1],[3,9,2],[2,4,1]]`, now we need to return sum of elements in the range for each `query`.where `query` represents `[start,end,1](type 1 query)` for sum in given range and `[index,val,2](type 2 query)` for update

- for query: [1,4,1] -> `1 + 8 + 2 + 1` = 12
- for query: [2,4,1] -> `8 + 2 + 1` = 11
- for query: [3,9,2] -> arr[3] = 9 so now arr=`0,1,8,9,1,5`
- for query: [2,4,1] -> `8 + 9 + 1` = 18

### what we have to change in our existing approach ?

> so our approach is same but we need to update our `segment tree` when there is `type 2` query.

- so what we have to do is from top down reach to that index where we need to change the arr and update the segment tree with `val`.
- now recusre back and update the `sum` at current index as `may be` the `child nodes` are updated.
