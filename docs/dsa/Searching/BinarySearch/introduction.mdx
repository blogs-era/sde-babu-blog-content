### Definition

> **Binary Search** is a `efficient` search technique in which we keep reducing our search space by dividing the array into `2 halves` and select any one half as a new search space.

:::note
Binary Search can only be applied on array which is already sorted
:::

### Approach

- initially our search space is from `low=0` to `high=n-1` means our target lie in this range.
- now extract the mid element because we want to reduce our search space by `half`.
- if mid element is our target then return the `mid(index)`
- if mid element is not our target then check
    - if target > `arr[mid]`, then our element lies in right half. hence now our search space is `low=mid+1 to high=high`
    - else our element lies in left half. hence now our search space is `low=low to high=mid-1`

class Main{
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr,int target) {
        int l = 0,h = arr.length-1;
        int mid = (l+h)/2;
        while(l<=h){
            // if the element is found at the mid return mid(index)
            if(arr[mid]==target)return mid;
            // if target is biiger than mid means our search space should be changed to [mid+1 to h]
            else if(target > arr[mid])l = mid+1;
            // if target is less than mid means our search space should be changed to [l to mid-1]
            else h = mid-1;
            // update the mid
            mid = (l+h)/2;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int[] arr = {0,3,4,8};
        int target = 4;
        int index = binarySearch(arr, target);
        System.out.print(target+" found at index: "+index);
    }
