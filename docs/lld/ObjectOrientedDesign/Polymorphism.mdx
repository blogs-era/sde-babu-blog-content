### Definition

Polymorphism refers to something that has many forms,shapes or behaviours. as we know no single form has an overall advantage and in softwares we need to cover wide variety of cases. so that we can modularize our software which can behave in many forms.

### image to understand polymorphism

> so in this image you can see a person in 3 forms. all the forms have different property/variable and behaviuor/function.

### Types of PolyMorphism

- #### Runtime Polymorphism
    - **Runtime polymorphism**, also known as Dynamic     
    Polymorphism, is the type of Polymorphism that happens at 
    the run time. What it means is it can't be decided by the 
    compiler. Therefore what form or behaviour has to be taken 
    depends upon the execution. Hence the name Runtime 
    Polymorphism.
    - it is same as method overriding.
    - in this inheritence is used in which subclass and 
    superclass has function with same name as with same number 
    and types of parameters but differs in implementation.

- #### Compile Time Polymorphism
    -  **Compile time polymorphism**, also known as Static   
    Polymorphism, refers to the type of Polymorphism that 
    happens at compile time. What it means is that the compiler 
    decides what shape or value has to be taken by the entity 
    during compilation.
    - it is same as method overloading.
    - in this there are more than one function/behaviour whose 
    names are same but differ from each other on the basis of 
    input parameters.

    public static void main(String[] argv){
        // compile-time/static/early polymorphism also known as method overloading and operator overloading
        Area area_object = new Area();
        // when we want to calculate the area which has width and height
        System.out.println(area_object.area(2,4));
        // when we want to calculate the area of circle
        System.out.println(area_object.area(10));
    }
}
