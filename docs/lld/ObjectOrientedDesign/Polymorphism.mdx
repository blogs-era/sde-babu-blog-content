### Definition

Polymorphism refers to something that has many forms,shapes or behaviours. as we know no single form has an overall advantage and in softwares we need to cover wide variety of cases. so that we can modularize our software which can behave in many forms.

### image to understand polymorphism

> so in this image you can see a person in 3 forms. all the forms have different property

### Types of PolyMorphism

- #### Runtime Polymorphism
- #### Compile Time Polymorphism

### Implementation of Compile Time PolyMorphism

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```js
class Area{
    int area(int height,int width){
        return height*width;
    }
    int area(int radius){
        return (int)(3.14 * radius * radius);
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] argv){
        // compile-time/static/early polymorphism also known as method overloading and operator overloading
        Area area_object = new Area();
        // when we want to calculate the area which has width and height
        System.out.println(area_object.area(2,4));
        // when we want to calculate the area of circle
        System.out.println(area_object.area(10));
    }
}
