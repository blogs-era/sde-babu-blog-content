### Definition

> OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model which mainly consist of **Object**. now what is object so in simple words objects are the real world entities which have some `properties` and `behavior`. **Object** is a instance of a **Class** or template.

### some major object oriented programming languages

- Java
- C++
- Javascript
- Python
- and many more

### need of OOPs

- it helps us to maintain and write more complex code
- most of it features help us reuse and modularize the code
- enhance the readability 

### Real world example where OOPS helps

![eg](https://share.sketchpad.app/22/be0-bb7a-8ac61b.png)

> hence **class** is a kind of template or a blueprint, which contains some values/member data/member variable and behaviors/functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions that are defined in that class.

> an **object** refers to the instance of a class which is a real world entity derived from class

```js
class Car {
    String name;
    String color;
    Car(String _name,String _color){
        this.color = _color;
        this.name = _name;
    }
    void start(){
        System.out.println("car: "+this.name+" started");
    }

    void stop(){
        System.out.println("car: "+this.name+" stopped");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] argv){
        // object 1 / instance 1
        Car car_object_1 = new Car("Alto","white");
        car_object_1.start();car_object_1.stop();
        // object 2 / instance 2
        Car car_object_2 = new Car("Swift","blue");
        car_object_2.start();car_object_2.stop();
    }
}


```

</TabItem>

currently no other languages supported
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Output

```
car: Alto started
car: Alto stopped
car: Swift started
car: Swift stopped
```

### Main Features of OOPs

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction
