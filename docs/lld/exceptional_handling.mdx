### What is Exception ?

> An exception is a special event, which is raised during the execution of a program at runtime, that brings the execution to a halt. The reason for the exception is the unexpected behaviour of a statement which stops the execution.

### What is Exception Handling ?

> so now we know that exceptions are very common in program no matter how good your code is but it can behave differently on different situation/input hance we need the handle the exception so that we can prevent our execution to be stopped.

### Example for exception handling with try-catch

```js

public class Main {
    public static double divideWithoutExceptionHandling(int numerator,int denominator){
        double result = (double) (numerator/denominator);
        return result;
    }
    public static double divideWithExceptionHandling(int numerator,int denominator){
        try{
            // so here a programmer have a idea that input can be wrong so we have to handle
            double result = (double) (numerator/denominator);
        }catch (ArithmeticException e){
            System.out.println("exception occur: "+e);
        }
        return -1;
    }
    public static void main(String[] argv){
        double res1 = divideWithExceptionHandling(2,0);
        double res2 = divideWithoutExceptionHandling(2,0);
    }
}

### Concept of multiple catch block

- the exception which occurs first in code block is raised.
- All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for `ArithmeticException` must come before catch for `Exception`.

            int res = 4/0;
        }catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("run when arithmetic exception found");
        }catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e){
            System.out.println("run when index bigger then equal to size of array");
        }catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println("general exception: "+e);
        }
    }
